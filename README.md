# Date-Calculator
This code will take your input of how many days ahead you want to calculate and it will tell you how that date in the future. 
There are 2 variables that you have to declare in the code. These two variables are your inputs. The first variable is called 'daysAhead' and it is the number of days ahead you want to calculate for. The second variable is called 'daysIntoYear' and it is the number of days you are into the year. Once you input those values, the code will run and will provide you with the future date. This code is programmed in java.
